# Project Description

## Project title: Safe 2 Ship

## Project description - What problem your app solves

An app to securely orchestrate and coordinate a community shipping effort thereby redistributing the workload to fulfill a community’s shipping needs and making shipping more convenient and less expensive. 

Many people roll around empty, burning fuel and not accomplishing much while usual courier systems are overworked and somewhat less convenient. How about going about your daily business as usual but also at your convenience securely participating in moving a package from one point to another and earning some money back for your fuel, transit fare or maintenance? 

That way, it would have been a double fruitful ride, less financial pressure on you, less pressure on the usual courier systems and less fuel burnt globally decongesting and lowering the carbon footprint of usual courier systems, considering climate change and global warming. There are many more benefits if you think of it.

## Target audience - Your app will be useful to whom?

Practically speaking, anyone (adult) in a community who would for any reason move from one point to another within that community (as scoped by the app) and anyone who has a package to move from one point to another in the community.
It can be an individual or a company in a local community–  in the position of a shipper or a shippee.
